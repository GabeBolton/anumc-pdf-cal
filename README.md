# ANUMC Wall Booking iCalendar

Here is the ical link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/05390fcdf8f06b35c5a635535d94f36e99a8ad5d35bde7c76096cb49095a3020%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics

Alternatively, download `anumc-wall-booking.ics` and import it into a new calendar on your preferred system.

Probably don't import it into your main calendar, make a new one that can be deleted if there are any updates.

There are some potential feature adds, like combining concurrent events and parsing from the facility name column to more readable names like 'Old Wall'/'New Wall'/'Both Walls'.
